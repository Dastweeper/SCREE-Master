I tried making the tank as simple as possible. The cannon, main body, and treads can be moved separately for visual effects and dynamism. I added silhouette versions so that it'd stand out better (as seen in the tank_example.png image), you can make it work by putting them onto three separate polygons, all of them behind the front layer, as children objects to the front polygons.

I'm still figuring out the propulsion system. I'm thinking of making two thrusters that'll pop out on the sides whenever it's in thrust/launch mode.Also, I'll give the tank treads a simple animation sequence (one or two frames) that I can make into a tile sheet.

For now you can use what's here for the game. I won't be making major changes to its design.

I hope that most of the time, the tanks will be viewed in a resolution at least 64x64. Anything smaller gets harder to make out the details.
